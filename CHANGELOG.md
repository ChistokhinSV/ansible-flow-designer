# Changelog

## 0.3.1 (AFD-5)

- Fixed: with the Red Hat YAML extension installed, `*.flow.yaml` was validated against SchemaStore's Estuary Flow Catalog schema (Estuary uses `flow.yaml`), which produced false "Property … is not allowed" errors. The extension now contributes `schema/flow.schema.json` for `*.flow.yaml` (`contributes.yamlValidation`), which outranks SchemaStore. The text view also gets completion and validation from the real flow schema. Checked by `just test-yaml`, which installs redhat.vscode-yaml 2.0.0.

## 0.3.0 — M3 (AFD-4)

- Spike of Option A semantics on ansible-core 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21 (`docs/spikes/m3-option-a.md`). Findings:
  - when every host of one play fails or is unreachable, the whole playbook stops;
  - `rescue` does not catch unreachable hosts;
  - role outcomes are invisible to the play;
  - the `max_fail_percentage` keyword never sees rescued hosts.
- Code generation behind an `Engine` interface (ADR-0009):
  - one playbook per flow level (`generated/<flow-key>.yml`, plus `<flow-key>.<subflow-key>.yml` per subflow level, run through `import_playbook`);
  - plays in graph order, `[key]` names, `node_<ULID>` tags and `flow_node_id`; routing with `group_by`;
  - every task node rescues, and an outcome play fails hosts on open ports and failed ends;
  - module bindings route `unreachable`, `unchanged` and `timeout`;
  - decisions, approvals (auto-approved locally), parallel and join (all/any), subflow bubbling, and a `max_fail_percentage` threshold task.
- Codegen on save (`afd.codegen.onSave`):
  - writes only changed files and never overwrites hand edits (checksum in the header);
  - removes stale level files;
  - _Generate Playbook_ command.
  - The golden files are `examples/generated/`; the handoff skeleton is superseded.
- Probe `afd_probe` (Python stdlib, JSON-lines session) with `inventory` and `syntax_check`, plus the `afd_events` callback. Both ship in the VSIX under `dist/probe`.
- Environments: Docker or Podman EE image, or a local interpreter. Our settings win, then the redhat.ansible settings. Native Windows needs a container.
- Run as skeleton (check mode) and _Run for real…_:
  - flow inputs remembered per flow;
  - the real-run confirmation names the inventory, host count, unknown names and production-looking groups;
  - the vault password is asked per run and passed through an environment variable only;
  - each launch is written to a local audit log;
  - the results are mapped back to the nodes (top bar status, last run in the inspector).
- _Check Generated Code (Syntax)_ runs `--syntax-check` in the environment. Errors go to the Problems panel on the generated files.
- New validator warnings: `port-role-unroutable`, `timeout-without-setting`, `no-targets`.
- The inspector shows each node's generated play.
- `docker/afd-ee.Dockerfile`, `just ee-build`, `just test-engine` (simulated outcomes in Docker), `just probe-test`, `just codegen`.

## 0.2.0 — M2 (AFD-3)

- Progressive port disclosure (D-14): at rest only wired, open-fail and open-on-purpose ports; hover (with a margin zone), selection or an open menu reveals every port of the type with labels; dragging a wire reveals inputs. Ports keep fixed slots.
- Port menus (04 §3, mockup 07): suggestions per port kind for open ports, Insert / Rewire / Disconnect for wired ones, Connect from/to another node by clicking it; same items in the inspector with quick fixes for open fail ports.
- Failure patterns (D-16): Rollback from backup (reuses the level's Rollback), Notify on-call and stop, Retry with backoff (rejoins the happy path), Exclude and report, plus Stop flow, Connect/Skip to Done, Escalate approval, Send run report. One command, one undo step; palette drag onto a port or node.
- Open on purpose: reason required, `by` from Git user.name (fallback OS user), edit reason, reopen; wiring a port removes its decision in the same edit.
- New commands: `applyPattern`, `setDecision`, `clearDecision`, `rewire`, `addNode.insertOn`, `addNode.freeze`. Edge IDs survive rewire and insert.
- Validator: `rollback-unreachable` (D-09), `duplicate-decision`, `decision-not-fail`.
- Fixed: selecting a node created from code (Quick add, patterns) while another node was selected looped the canvas (React Flow selection echo).
- ADR-0008.

## 0.1.0 — M1 (AFD-2)

- Custom editor for `*.flow.yaml` (`CustomTextEditorProvider`): the extension host is the only writer; every canvas action is one minimal `WorkspaceEdit`, so undo, dirty state and save are VS Code's.
- Byte-preserving YAML edit engine (`src/core/yaml`): path ops, style detection (EOL, indent, sequence indentation), YAML 1.1/1.2-safe quoting, anchor/alias guards; seeded fuzz harness.
- Flow model, port catalog, semantic validation and open fail ports with subflow bubbling; findings in the Problems panel.
- Schema v1 with additive fields: `join_mode`, `branches`, `handler`, `targets`, port names with digits.
- Design canvas (React Flow 12): node types and statuses, ports by side and state, wires by tone, far LOD; palette, Quick add, inspector, flow description, open-port banner.
- Layout in one flat `layout:` block; in-memory ELK auto-layout for flows without positions; Tidy up.
- `flow.version` bumped once per commit relative to Git HEAD.
- Theme tokens for light, dark and high-contrast themes with contrast tests; strict webview CSP.
- Tests: Vitest (core, webview), VS Code integration and performance suites; `just` recipes for everything.
- Decisions recorded in `docs/adr/0001`–`0007`.
